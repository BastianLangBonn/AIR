To run the code:
- open terminal and change to src-directory
- compile java code using 'javac org/brsu/assignments/assignment4/Assignment4Runner.java'
- run code using 'java org.brsu.assignments.assignment4.Assignment4Runner "<mapname>"'

The last command takes one of the following arguments: "map1", "map2", "map3"
After running the command the application will run the algorithm on the map. After the computation
of the path has finished, statistics are printed to the console and a frame opens, displaying
the map and the path found.
